This MCP is a skill and MCP router. The host harness may also expose other \
MCP servers and tools used by coding agents.

REQUIRED: Before using another MCP to write or make a consequential change, \
call list_skills, then get_skill for the matching workflow.

Routing hints:
  - Turn a PRD into work      → create-agent-tasks
  - Execute one task          → implement-agent-task
  - Validate completed work   → review-agent-task
  - Pull request feedback     → address-review-feedback
  - Design files              → create-design-request
  - Product docs              → create-prd / clarify-prd
  - Ask the user one decision at a time → grill-me
  - Which skill to pick       → help

This catalog ships portable workflows. Do not invent missing requirements \
or tool inputs — inspect available context, then ask the user when needed.`
